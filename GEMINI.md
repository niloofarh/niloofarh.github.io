# Project: Niloofar Hajiheidari - UI/UX Designer Portfolio

## Project Overview

This project is a personal portfolio website for Niloofar Hajiheidari, a UI/UX Designer. It is a static website built using pure HTML, CSS (inline and embedded `<style>`), and JavaScript (embedded `<script>`) for interactive elements like mobile navigation and scroll animations. The website showcases the designer's skills, experience, projects, education, and contact information. It is intended for deployment via GitHub Pages, where pushing changes to the `main` branch of the `niloofarh.github.io` repository automatically updates the live site.

## Key Files

*   **`index.html`**: The single main entry point for the website. It contains all the structural content, styling definitions, and interactive JavaScript logic.
*   **`Portfolio - Niloofar Hajiheidari.pdf`**: The user's design portfolio in PDF format, likely linked from the website for download or viewing.
*   **`Resume - Niloofar Hajiheidari.pdf`**: The user's resume in PDF format, also likely linked for download.

## Building and Running

This is a static website and does not require a build step. It can be run by opening `index.html` directly in a web browser.

To view the website locally:
1.  Navigate to the project directory.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., `open index.html` on macOS, or double-click the file in your file explorer).

## Deployment

The website is designed for deployment on GitHub Pages. Changes pushed to the `main` branch of the associated GitHub repository (`niloofarh.github.io`) will be automatically deployed.

### To update and deploy the website:

1.  **Make changes**: Edit `index.html` or update the PDF files as needed.
2.  **Stage changes**:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
3.  **Commit changes**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Descriptive message about your changes"
    ```
4.  **Push to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
    After pushing, allow a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build and deploy the updated site.
    The website will be accessible at: `https://niloofarh.github.io`
